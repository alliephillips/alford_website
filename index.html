      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Hi! This is Me.</h2>
      <p>This site is where I toss updates to my teaching and research and post links to funny things so I don't forget about them. And I don't want to hear any snarky comments about this being made with Google Sites. I know there are swankier options out there, but I'd rather spend my time doing other things, like defending the Oxford comma.  </p>

      <p>I am a Lecturer and Research Investigator here at the University of Michigan. I have a wide range of research interests, so I'm always up to something new. I have taught Engr 100: Intro to Engineering -- Underwater Vehicle Design since 2008, and it is so much fun.  I have taught Engr 101: Introduction to Computer Programming since 2015, and it is also so much fun.  If you happened across this page because you are a new student in either of these classes, then welcome! I look forward to meeting you. If you are a random person, also welcome! I probably won't get to meet you, alas.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I finally got around to making a Twitter account, but it's really just to post pictures and videos from the Engr 100 ROV Competition.  Don't get too excited that I'll post much beyond that.  Sorry.  If you want to contact me, go ahead and email me.  Go Blue!!</p>
